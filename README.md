# TamunoPreye - 3-column preview card component

## Made a design close to the below .jpg file 
![Design preview for the 3-column preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge
1.
- Used cssflexbox for this challenge and i had issues making sure the card components was by default equally aligned together, i tried using flex properties such as 
- align-self
- flex-shrink and
- flex-grow.

### But i was finding it difficult to use those properties so instead i just used padding and set it to 10px which aligned all the items (p && buttons) equally and then it became desktop responsive.

2.
- I also carried the colors from the styles.md file which was provided on download and used them in my project.

3.
- The card component is mobile responsive from desktop to laptop as i set my media query to start from 580px down.
